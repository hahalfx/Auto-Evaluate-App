本文件夹用于存放迭代过程中淘汰的代码，但是对于功能的开发仍然具有参考价值。
1. 迭代1：machine-response.tsx 代码组件不存粹，存在很多副作用代码，需要重构。

    Key Improvements in the Refactored Code

    Separation of Concerns: Extracted voice recognition and audio playback to dedicated custom hooks, making the component itself much cleaner and more focused on rendering.

    Pure Component: The component now primarily handles UI rendering with minimal side effects directly in the component.

    Improved State Management: State is now managed in dedicated hooks, making it easier to test, reuse, and maintain.

    Better Error Handling: Consistent error handling approach throughout the code.

    Reduced Component Size: The main component is now much smaller and easier to understand.

    Reusability: The extracted hooks can be reused in other components as needed.

    Cleaner useImperativeHandle: The ref logic is now more focused and clearer.

    Better Cleanup: Consistent cleanup in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks.
